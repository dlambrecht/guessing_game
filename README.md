For this guessing game the user is prompted to guess how many
states in the US I have been to.
If the user puts in the correct answer an alert comes up that
says "That's Right!"
If the user puts in an incorrect answer an alert comes up that
says "Nope. Try Again" and they will have to try until hey get it correct.

Update: Made object quizGame and added method and properties to it.
Quiz still acts the same just methodology in code has changed.
